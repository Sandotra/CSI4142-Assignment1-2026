# CSI4142 Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

**Course:** CSI4142 Fundamentals of Data Science (Winter 2026)  
**Assignment:** Assignment 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Authors:** [Your Name] & [Partner's Name]  

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and datasets for Assignment 1. The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two distinct datasets from different domains[cite: 6, 81]. 

## Datasets
[cite_start]Per the assignment requirements, the datasets are hosted directly in this repository to ensure the code runs without requiring local downloads[cite: 29, 39].

### Dataset 1: Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior
* [cite_start]**Domain:** Technology/Mobile Behavior [cite: 77]
* **Source:** Kaggle
* [cite_start]**Description:** Analysis of user behavior including app usage time, battery drain, and device models[cite: 75].

### Dataset 2: Used Car Sales (Audi, BMW, Ford, VW, etc.)
* **Domain:** Automotive
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Description:** Analysis of resale values, mileage, transmission types, and fuel efficiency across various manufacturers.

## Technologies Used
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn [cite: 57, 58]

## How to Run
1. Open the `CSI4142_Assignment1.ipynb` file in this repository.
2. The notebook is configured to read the CSV files directly from this repository via raw URLs.
